# Overview

This repository contains the data and implementation for the paper <a href="https://bdqnghi.github.io/files/icse-18-nier.pdf">Hierarchical Learning of Cross-Language Mappings through Distributed Vector Representations for Code </a>, in Proceedings of the <a href="https://www.icse2018.org/"> IEEE/ACM 40th International Conference on Software Engineering: New Ideas and Emerging Technologies Results Track (ICSE-NIER), Gothenburg, Sweden, 2018 </a>

Since we found that the implementation of BiSkip2Vec from <a href="https://github.com/eske/multivec">Multivec</a> has better performance than our implementation, we recommend the researchers that want to reproduce our result use Multivec for training the token embeddings.
